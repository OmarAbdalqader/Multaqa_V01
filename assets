# Multaqa (ملتقى) — Smart 3D University Ecosystem (In Development)

 **Status:** 🚧 Under Development (Documentation & UI/Concept Previews Only — No source code published)

## Overview
**Multaqa** is a smart platform that connects **Universities, Students, and Companies** in one integrated ecosystem.
The goal is to transform the university experience into a **3D + AI guided digital campus** where students can explore, discover opportunities, and access services easily.

## The Problem
Many students face repeated issues across their university journey:
- **1st year:** confusion and stress (buildings, halls, offices, where to go).
- **2nd/3rd year:** missing workshops, events, and skill-building opportunities due to scattered info.
- **4th year / Graduates:** difficulty finding **internships** and **job opportunities**, and reaching the right companies.
- **Companies:** no unified, official channel to reach students with targeted training, internships, and jobs.

## The Solution
Multaqa provides:
- A **3D Campus Map** for each university (interactive buildings, colleges, and event pins).
- **360° Virtual Tours** for colleges and facilities (immersive panoramic tour).
- **Two-level AI Guidance**:
  - **System-level AI** (invoked by “يا ملتقى”) to navigate universities/companies/posts quickly.
  - **University-level AI** to guide students inside a specific university (halls, events, colleges).
- **Interactive Study Plan Tree (D3-style)**:
  - Degree plan shown as a tree with prerequisites.
  - Each course opens a **Course Details page** (outcomes, hours, prerequisites, etc.).
- **Smart Schedule Assistant**
  - Students provide their year/semester and intended courses.
  - AI suggests the **best possible schedule** based on prerequisites and constraints.
- **Targeted Posts**
  - Universities and companies can publish posts with targeting by **college / department / year / audience**.
- **Verified Student Identity (Optional Feature)**
  - Student ID + student number + live face capture for verification (AI matching).
- **Digital University Services**
  - Universities can add **dynamic services** using configurable forms (online / on-campus, paid / free).

## Key Modules
- **University Space:** 3D campus, event pins, colleges & facilities pages.
- **Students Space:** personalized discovery, events, plans, schedule support.
- **Companies Space:** internships, jobs, workshops, targeted announcements.
- **External Community:** view universities/companies and enroll in company offerings.
